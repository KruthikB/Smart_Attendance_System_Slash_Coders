# Smart Attendance System // Slash Coders


<p>
  
  <i><b> 🧮Working of the Model :</b></i><br>
  <br>
  Developed a Smart Attendance System for online as well as offline system. <br>
  It basically generate a smart and unique id for each students and these id <br>
  will be scannned byr the scanner before the entry of class aand after that the <br>
  facce recognition portal scan and capture the image and match with the databse <br>
  if the student is authorized it will make him enter the class and mark present or <br> vice versa.<br>
  <br>
  For the offline system we are having RFID Scanners to scan the ID and check the <br> authorizd user.<br>
  Even it can keep the track of students where they are actually in campus and all.
